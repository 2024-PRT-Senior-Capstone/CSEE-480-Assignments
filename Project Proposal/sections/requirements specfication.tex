\begin{enumerate}
    \item Equip a PRT car with a Raspberry Pi 4 model B. 
    \item The Raspberry Pi should be in an enclosure with a footprint that 15cm x 10cm x 8cm.
    \item The enclosure should not be seen or disturbed by the occupants. The enclosure should not interfere with typical use or passengers.
    \item Collect PRT car movement via GPS tracking with accuracy of +/- 5m.
    \item Collect PRT energy consumption data via measurements up to 50A to within 5\% with a current clamp.
    \item Collect occupancy via LiDAR or Infrared. 
    \item Sync data from the car to the database via encrypted WVU Wifi. 
    \item Store data in an SQL database.
    \item Analyze collected data to generalize PRT car behaviors. 
    \item Present data through a single-page front-end display.
    \item Allow a user to perform analysis and visualization.
