Even though the PRT operates with a movement rate of roughly 15,000 students per day, it is not without faults or need of improvement. During consistently busy times of the day, wait times are much longer than expected and at other times, commuters are left waiting at a platform as empty cars leave. By equipping PRT cars with a telematics device, these types of scenarios can be avoided. Furthermore, equipping cars with sensors to track data such as power consumption, GPS location, and passenger capacity allows for analysis and thus provides further insights into how the PRT system can be more efficient in both transportation and energy consumption.
