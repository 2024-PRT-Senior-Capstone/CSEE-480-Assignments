While the PRT, in its current state, serves WVUâ€™s students appropriately, the system is not without its faults. Despite a movement rate of roughly 15,000 students per day, there are times when commuters are left waiting at a platform as empty cars leave. By equipping the PRT cars with a telematics device, some of these scenarios can be avoided. Equipping cars with sensors to track data such as power consumption, GPS location, and passenger capacity allows data to be analyzed to provide insights into how the PRT can be more efficient in transportation and energy consumption.
