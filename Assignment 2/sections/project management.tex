In the development of the project throughout the design semester, our project management approach most closely followed the Agile development lifecycle. 
While we did not spend too much time laying out our approach, we used previous experiences to create a development process that works best for each member of the group. 
The features of such process, completed weekly or biweekly, include a weekly group meeting to discuss project progress, individual work time, group testing, and a reevaluation of progress upon each deliverable or goal met. 
The goals for each cycle of our development were determined on a rolling basis, opting to identify which aspects of the project should be focused on for the week that we met. 

We schedule non optional meetings at least once a week, with occasional meetings occurring after class on Wednesdays and Fridays as needed for group work and testing. 
Our document organization was done through common cloud platforms such as Google Drive, GitHub, and Discord. 
In the future, a more rigid set of rules for a development lifecycle would lend the group well to meet more deadlines, as spending time each week to decide goals can become inefficient.
