\underline{Role:} I chose to attend every meeting we had with questions, concerns, and ideas about the project goal so we could outline the team’s objectives clearly. 
As a group, we ensured each member was on the same page. 
I kept track of our budget and the amount we had spent. 
Although the roles in the team weren’t clearly defined, we equally shared responsibilities such as ordering materials, tracking the budget, setting our achievable goals before the next meeting, and brainstorming ideas during meetings.

\underline{Tasks Completed:} The tasks I completed during this semester were sharing thoughts and ideas contributing to the goals of our project. 
I attended all meetings and ensured we were all on the same page before dismissing–having a clear understanding of our roles and responsibilities before meeting again was important to clear up confusion among the members. 
I ordered the parts for the current clamp and designed the hardware architecture, software architecture, and system functionality diagram. 
I contributed to the overall architecture design at the beginning of the semester. 
I contributed to the design choices throughout the semester and wrote the design choices section in the Final Report. 
I also completed the Overall architecture, Hardware architecture, Software architecture, and Timeline sections. 
The last design I completed was to create the wire for the current clamp. 
I created a pinout architecture from the GPS and the Raspberry Pi.

\underline{Results:} The architectures from Figure 4 shown above were modeled to create the Raspberry Pi and its hardware connections necessary to finish the hardware portion of our project. 
Interfacing the current clamp onto the Raspberry Pi and GPS module correctly required knowledge of the Pi and GPS pinout. 
Figure 7 represents this pinout configuration and was used to connect the current clamp Pi hat to the Raspberry Pi.
