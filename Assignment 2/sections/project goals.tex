\subsection{Outline}
The PRT capstone group will implement data collection technology to address a fundamental lack of ability to gather information about PRT car GPS location, capacity, and power utilization. 
Implications of this project include increased safety and the ability to analyze collected data to make generalizations about PRT usage and provide new, efficient solutions to common issues.

\subsection{System}
Collection of PRT usage data will be done via a telematics device that is equipped to a PRT car. 
This solution is considered a subsystem of the larger PRT System as its operation is separate. 
The work done by this project group will be done in addition to the typical operation of WVUâ€™s PRT System, ensuring the solution does not interfere with the expected daily operation of the PRT.

The PRT data collection system will be implemented on each car, forming a larger network of Raspberry Pi devices. 
The following report describes the individual Raspberry Pi collection device, but it should be noted that the concept is scalable.
